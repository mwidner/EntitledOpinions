Stanford Image
==============

This module provides an image Field Collection and associated Display Suite view modes.
It requires the stanford_image_styles module, and is the foundation for several other modules.

Note: if you enable only this module, the Field Collection will not appear at admin/structure/field-collections.
You will need to enable another module (stanford_page, stanford_slide) that leverages this one if you want to
re-use this Field Collection.
